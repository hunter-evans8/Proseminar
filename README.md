# Overview

Welcome to my project from my research as an undergraduate student. This project highlights skills in R, such as graphing and simulating data, and has some heavy statistical theory.

Here is the full paper I have written about this topic and presented in front of a math commitee: [Hunter_Proseminar_Final.pdf](Hunter_Proseminar_Final.pdf)


Here is a link to the raw code that I have compiled: [01_Code.md](01_Code.md)



# The Question

Poisson regression has a assumption called equidispersion, which means the mean and variance are equal. In this project we wanted to see what would happen if we made data overdispered, where the mean is less than the variance, and applied it to Poisson and Negative Binomial, which is a model that can handle overdispered data. The question we wanted to answer is at what point do these models converge onto each other, and running Poisson is just as good as running Negative Binomal.
